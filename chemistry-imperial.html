            For years I assumed Coca-Cola was just a common, refreshing beverage. Then one day, to my surprise, I came across its application as a cleaning agent. This struck me as something slightly odd, how can something used for removing oil stains be such a pleasant drink? Chemistry held the answer, though this is just a trivial example. Through chemistry we have safe drinking water and aluminium for aeroplanes. This scope and relevance makes me keen to learn more. I am eager for the opportunity to contribute to today's world, no matter which field of chemistry I may enter in the future.

            Among my favourite experiences in chemistry class was determining the mechanism of reaction between ammonia and 1-chloropropane. I especially enjoyed this exercise because I had to apply my previous knowledge about the behaviour of reagents in order to independently deduce the mechanism and products of this reaction. It was particularly satisfying as the correct conclusion could be reached through the use of logical and deductive thinking alone. My favourite reaction, likewise related to mechanisms, is between ethene and bromine in the presence of sodium chloride. It showed me one way chemists can test if what they assume to be mechanism in theory, happens in practice.

            I enjoy chemistry as I am able to read through topics alone, helping me understand them better when they are being studied in the classroom, though I also have the opportunity to expand my knowledge in a group. This can be in practical sessions or discussions about the material being learnt. An example is when my AS chemistry class was engaged in debate on whether anthropogenic emissions are a cause for concern, as part of the green chemistry module. Both sides used the same data and I was able to look at it individually before presenting and discussing ideas as a member of a group. The exercise demonstrated how scientific data could be used in a number of ways, which highlighted the necessity of being able to interpret it accurately, a skill which I hope to develop further at university.

            Due to finding mathematics captivating as well, I studied my A2 applied mathematics module independently during the summer. I find mathematics is rewarding by itself but I appreciate it doubly as it is relevant and complementing to studying chemistry. Having an active interest in physics, I have joined the Institute of Physics to be able to view up to date information on the subject and have access to sources such as Physics World magazine.

        Outside school curricula, I have been participating in the Duke of Edinburgh Award for three years. My gold expedition took place in the Czech Republic, and I was able to act as a translator and coordinator due to being able to speak Slovak, which is mutually intelligible with Czech. This was an ideal way to develop and apply my communication and team-working skills, both of which are necessary to succeed as a chemist. I have watched a number of chemistry lectures posted by universities on video-sharing websites. A topic I especially enjoyed in the lectures discussed using formal charge to predict the best Lewis structure for covalent molecules and how this can then be expanded to predict the 3D shape of the molecule.
        </p>
        At university, I am especially interested in using analytical techniques such as X-ray crystallography and infrared spectroscopy, as so far I have only explored them in theory. I am thrilled at the prospect of studying chemistry in further depth, and have been watching university lectures and podcasts to expand on what I already know. This was not only educational but also reinforced my desire to apply for chemistry and choose it as my career.
