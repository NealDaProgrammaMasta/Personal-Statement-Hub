            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            My interest in current affairs, politics and the way in which the global economy operates, has fuelled my intentions to read economics at university. Furthermore, I am longing to be able to answer questions such as, how do various stock markets function, for example such as the FTSE 100 and other stock markets, and what effects do they have upon our everyday lives, as well as on businesses and companies? How is it possible for multi-million pound companies, such as Enron, to go into liquidation? I eventually plan to pursue a career in international trade or within the civil service. I believe that a career in economics will help me to accomplish this goal. These career paths are both exciting and of great interest to me, as they will allow me to in-corporate the elements of economics, law and politics in one career. Also they will allow me to interact and communicate with a diverse range of people from around the world, and will give me the chance to travel and work around the world
            </p>
            My current subjects are helping me to establish a good platform for my university course. I enjoyed science at school, and therefore took up AS level biology. I am currently studying economics, government + politics and chemistry at A2 level. I particularly enjoy learning about the different market structures in our economy, and am intrigued by the way the government and the economy operate. Studying politics, has also aided my economics study, as I have learnt about the power hierarchy and the ways in which the government intervenes, to help, and at times hinder, the economy. Chemistry has always been a fascinating subject for me, and has helped me to keep up my numerical skills
            <p>
            I have gained some work experience, from a placement in a travel agent company, within their accounts department. I dealt with invoices, cancellations, and the weekly and monthly banking. I developed many skills from my work there, such as communication skills, when dealing with customers, and organisational skills, when sorting cancellations and bookings
            </p>
            In addition, I have a weekly commitment within a Saturday school, teaching Indian classical music to children. I have the responsibility of teaching these students to the best of my ability, whilst maintaining a safe and workable environment. This gives me immense pride, to teach my students, and impart on them the knowledge I have learnt
            </p>
            My main interests outside of college are within the world of music. I have been playing the tabla, an Indian classical instrument, for 12 years now and am currently learning at an advanced stage. I have played on numerous occasions, in concerts, with various bands, in front of thousands of people. The highlight of my musical career has been to play in Wembley Arena. Music has not only inspired my mind, but has also pushed me to do more in life, and to one day become a great artist within my field. Playing along side other musicians has also given me great communication and teamwork skills, as well as the ability to improvise under pressure. Playing music has intrigued my mind, and I feel that it has also aided me in my academic studies
            </p>
            I also enjoy playing a range of sports such as football and cricket. I am part of a cricket club, which gives me the opportunity to train all year round, and to play in competitive matches in the summer. I hope to make full use of the sporting and musical facilities available at university
            </p>
            I hope my personal statement has demonstrated that I am a keen and suitable person for this course, and that I would also easily adapt to student life. An economics degree will help me to further enhance my diverse range of analytical, interpretational and problem-solving skills, which I will be able to apply to, not only my career, but also to my everyday student life.
