            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            Philosophy's universality fascinates me. Whether it be the logical analysis of language, the questioning of how society should be run, or the applied ethics of new issues, like the development of AI and its implications on consciousness, Philosophy raises important questions about perspectives held in all areas of life. I completed my EPQ on how the Russian Nihilist Movement affected the development of nihilism. I began with the roots of nihilism as an Enlightenment rejection of previous philosophical values where science was embraced in place of religion. I compared this to the Russian Nihilist Movement where I followed nihilism's transformation into a rejection of right-wing politics and more of a social identity. I explored how this influenced its later popularisation by Nietzsche, who gave it a determinist definition, linking back to how moral and religious values were rejected in the Enlightenment era.
            </p>
            This interest is connected to my broader interest in metaethics. I therefore wrote a Caius Explore essay on whether morality is objective or subjective. I argued that it was objective on the grounds that morality must hold meaning in the face of moral disagreements, which it could not do if morality was subjective. On reflection, I found myself not wholly convinced by my argument, finding that it was harder to prove objectivity rather than just break down subjectivity. I also felt this was the more central argument for objectivity discussed by S Blackburn in 'Being Good' and B Williams in 'Morality'. Blackburn's argument involved having objective reasons that could justify moral arguments, and Williams' was centred around disproving subjectivism due to its watering-down of moral values, rather than actively justifying morality's objectivity.
            <p>
            I was perplexed on how to approach this problem, and looked to Biology and Psychology for objective answers on how we create moral judgements, where I discovered T Crane's 'The Mechanical Mind'. While not focussed on ethics, the book discussed computational theories of cognition in reference to human and machine consciousness, making me wonder if a conscious AI would be capable of moral reasoning. Beginning the book, I assumed AI could not become conscious, but warmed to the idea when faced with how 'mechanical' the mind may be, and if it were so then creating consciousness and furthermore a moral entity may not be impossible. One fascinating distinction that occurred to me was the disconnect between human and artificial consciousness due to a lack of societal presence for the machine. I was reminded of the subjectivist perspective JS Mill took in 'On Liberty'. Mill looked at morality from an external, social perspective and contended we should judge actions based on the consequences.
            </p>
            While I felt this perspective on morality was one dimensional, I recognised the importance of societal influence and I wanted to find out more. This led me to read PF Strawson's 'Freedom and Resentment', where he contended that adopting an objective attitude to people in a moral sense is to see them as an "object of social policy", and that reactive attitudes indicate we should hold people morally responsible even in the face of determinism. However, I questioned if these same moral judgements that Strawson and Mill focussed on would hold in the case of a conscious AI; a product of society, but not a participant in it in the same way that humans are. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing the guitar and I am a Red Cross volunteer.
            </p>
            I have also participated in the Oxford MUN as well as the Bar Mock Trial regionals and nationals. I take interest in Philosophy as a subject with a rich history that gives a glimpse into humanity and the development of thought throughout time. It also interests me as a subject that is forever advancing alongside new scientific research, from AI to evolution. Philosophy's breadth in these areas and many more make it a subject which I thoroughly look forward to contributing to.
