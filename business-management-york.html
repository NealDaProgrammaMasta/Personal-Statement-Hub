            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            For as long as I can remember it has been my fondest dream and my furthest goal to attend college. From the beginning, I knew it would be an uphill climb to gain admission into a prestigious university. I have worked long and hard to get good grades in order for me to attend a university. I was finally admitted to the University of California Riverside. If I graduate from college I will be the first in my family. But, lately I have realized that I cannot reach my dreams alone; I would need financial assistance. My father was laid off from his job four months ago and my mother is unemployed. We're barely able to make our housing payments, utility and insurance bills. And if that weren't enough school tuition has dramatically gone up. I also have two other brothers who have to attend a university, but my family can't afford it. I need assistance financially. By being a recipient of a scholarship from Riverside Community College I will be able to alleviate this need, and possibly be the first member in my family to graduate from college
            </p>
            Through much research and self-analysis I have decided that I would pursue a career in International Business. This field offers competitive salary to college grads, gives a chance to travel to different parts of the world, and is also a competitive field in today's continually globalizing economy, which has caused a demand for those with international expertise. After receiving my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration at the University of California Riverside, I plan to continue my education until I receive a Masters and Doctorate degree in International Marketing
            <p>
            I decided that a career in International Business is for me because I have traveled to many foreign countries throughout my life and have excelled in foreign languages. I have a solid background in the English and Spanish languages and I also know a little of Italian
            </p>
            Being Bolivian and living in the United States has given me an interesting, well rounded outlook on the world. I am a blend of two opposing lifestyles, and my thoughts, ideas, and actions reflect this blend. I have a thorough knowledge of the American and Spanish cultural lifestyles which I believe would be of an advantage to me when I pursue a career in international marketing. I am also in the process of gaining business knowledge and experience by working and running my parent's family shoe store. I take care of the bookkeeping, retail sales, and the ordering and purchasing of merchandise. But with the recent economic downturn it has been very difficult to maintain the business in a profit gain. Although our business is not doing well it is giving me a chance to see if I am capable of handling a business during a challenging situation by using a powerful business strategy: consumer focused marketing
            </p>
            Therefore, my ultimate career aspiration is to become a successful executive in an international company playing a leadership role in customer focused marketing. As an international businesswoman I would be employed by a specific company, one in which would be in the need for an individual with foreign language and business skills. Chances are I would frequently travel between countries, and conduct business with officials of the foreign country in which we are doing business
            </p>
            I would need to possess a well-rounded business knowledge that includes expertise in finance, marketing, and personnel management. I hope to gain this knowledge by studying at a University. Also, while still attending classes at the University, I hope to study abroad for a semester, in the process immersing myself in another culture, and deepening my personal and academic understanding of International Business
            </p>
            After studying abroad and receiving my degree, I would like to volunteer to work for a non-profit organization. Then after gaining business knowledge and most importantly business experience, I will enter the exciting international corporate world. In the long-run, I envision for myself a career straddling the highest levels of international business as a corporate leader. I am confident that my determination, perseverance and tenacity will lead me to the successful achievement of this personal vision.
