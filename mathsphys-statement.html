            Before year 10, I had no real enthusiasm for physics or maths. It wasn't until I reached year 10 that I finally understood the reason for this. During that year, we were introduced to a new maths teacher who completely changed my perspective, not only in maths but also in physics. I was fascinated to learn that mathematicians and physicists could predict seemingly complicated outcomes by manipulating and solving equations. Now, everything I learn contributes to my growing understanding of how the world works. What truly captivates me, though, is the realisation of how much we still don't know. Which is exactly why I am drawn to studying physics at the university level.

            At the end of last year, I won the Schools Maths and Physics Excellence Award. My Physics Teacher, aware of my keen interest in astrophysics, presented me with one of his favourite books, "Gravitational Waves: How Einstein's Spacetime Ripples Reveal the Secrets of the Universe" by Brian Clegg. During our study of particle physics, our focus turned to the 'quantums' of different fields. This led us to the proposed 'graviton'. As we continued, I found the methods to uncover new particles quite fascinating, specifically how scientists recreate conditions similar to the Big Bang in accelerators.

            I have written a research paper that derives a numerical solution to the period of a physical pendulum with a large initial angle. My Physics Internal Assessment (IA) focused on investigating the physical pendulum. During my study, I realised that the existing equation relied on the small-angle approximation, which limited its accuracy. This led me to wonder if I could derive a formula for determining the time period of large-angle oscillations, without using the approximation. Thus, towards the end of my IA, I explored a possible extension and, out of curiosity, successfully developed a formula within a small margin of error. During this process, I learned LaTeX, enhancing the clarity and professionalism of my papers.

            My Physics Extended Essay (EE) was an aerodynamics project. To deepen my understanding of aerodynamics, I immersed myself in insightful books. "Mechanics of Flight" by Warren E. Phillips provided valuable mathematical tools relevant to my project. Additionally, I studied the later specification of the book, "Mechanics of Flight" by A. C. Kermode, which introduced me to the fundamental principles of flight. These resources laid a solid foundation for my comprehension of aerodynamics, enabling remarkable success in my aerospace project. I aimed to investigate the effect of trailing-edge flap deflection on aerodynamic performance in an airfoil. Despite being previously told that this project is a highly ambitious task, I was still eager to pursue it. I took on the challenge of constructing a subsonic wind tunnel at home, which was successful. However, the most intriguing part of the project was constructing the relevant theory from which I could draw a hypothesis. I aimed to develop an equation relating the coefficient of lift to the deflection of the trailing-edge flaps. Although highly rigorous, this was a successful endeavour that expanded my knowledge into advanced mathematical techniques. To gain the relevant prerequisites for my EE, I studied the MOOC "Introduction to Aerodynamics" offered by The Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with videos from MIT OpenCourseWare and The 'Mechanics of Flight' specifications.

            Beyond academics, my passion lies in chess. I consistently put my skills to the test and have achieved notable success, securing high scores in several competitions. Additionally, I have a consistent part-time job handing out magazines to houses and being a part-time coach, coaching children at my local tennis club.

            Since I was a child, my heart has yearned to do something extraordinary. While I have received advice to pursue financially focused paths for stability, my true purpose lies in understanding the world around us.
