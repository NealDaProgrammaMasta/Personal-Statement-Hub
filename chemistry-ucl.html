            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            Chemistry is my first choice when it comes to university courses. I am interested in all areas of Chemistry – from kinetics and equilibrium to organic compounds and their formation. However I find practical work most enjoyable and I am looking forward to the more ‘hands on’ experience at university level. This subject allows me to look at concepts known from GCSE or Key Stage 3 lessons from a different perspective. Also, as I am studying Biology at A level, it lets me understand the Biochemistry in greater depth. Originally, a Pharmaceutical Science degree was on my mind. After giving it much thought and talking to one of the Chemistry professors in a Higher Education fair, I changed my choice to Chemistry as it is a broad subject that will give me a chance to study a wide range of modules and keep my options open for the future.

            I started UK schooling in Year 10 after my family moved to the UK from Lithuania. Being in a new country, a new school and learning a new language was a challenge that I feel I have overcome by achieving sufficient grades to go to Sixth Form and doing well enough to consider continuing my education. Several moves in my life have taught me self-reliance and confidence.
            <p>
            My work experience in Year 10 was in a local National Trust property as a Gardener’s Assistant. During those two weeks I was working as a part of a team doing assigned tasks and helping out whenever possible. After the placement I was offered a job as a Catering Assistant in the same property where I still work as a part of big team and meet many new and interesting people. I have worked there for nearly three seasons and I think that interacting with people outside school, friends or family has improved my English language, social skills and gave me valuable experience
            </p>
            Outside school I volunteer at a community centre on Friday evenings. There I help to teach English by translating to and from Lithuanian or Russian. I find this very enjoyable as this is a way to help people who are really struggling and, being an immigrant myself, I can empathise with their situation. Also, I was honoured to be chosen to become a Language Leader by the school staff and will be attending the Language Leaders Conference on December 16th. I see this as another opportunity of helping students who learn English as a second language.
        </p>
        After living in a small village in the middle of Cambridgeshire, I am looking forward to living in a student community with all its perks and challenges. I understand that it will be a big change from Sixth Form, but I also am eager to make the most of the experience.
