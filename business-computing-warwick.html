            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            My passion with computers stated to grow when I learned accounting. I found that computers are powerful tools which can help businesses with analyzing the mass of data and making decisions. I believe that a person with both business knowledge and computer skill will be in large demand in China, especially after it has entered the WTO. Hence, I would like to choose a degree combined with business and computing study for my further education in the UK
            </p>
            I am currently enjoying my study in the Northern Consortium International Foundation program. The courses I learn include Business, English Academic Purposes, Information Computer Training, Pure Mathematic, Society and Politics. I have got used to these English-teaching courses and done satisfactorily, especially Pure Mathematic and Information Computer Training. I am extremely interested in this two courses and have absolute confidence in them
            <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy a wide range of activities. I spend lots of time on reading. Computer and scientific magazines are my favorites. I am also keen on playing computer games and surfing on the internet which greatly benefits my study
            </p>
            I choose Britain for my future study because of its world-class reputation. I believe that this is a wise choice which will give me many advantages for my future career. I will try my best to achieve my dream and enjoy my study in the UK university.
