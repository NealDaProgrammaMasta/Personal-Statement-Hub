            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            As far back as I can remember, I have been fascinated by computers and electronics. I have always enjoyed learning more about them and their applications, and how I can use them. As a small child with my first family PC, I have longed for a deeper understanding of computing, and this has shaped my educational choices inside school, as well as other projects outside of school.
            </p>
            I started out making basic web pages in HTML, and have since expanded upon these with dynamic content such as JavaScript and Flash. Recently, I enhanced my knowledge of Flash and ActionScript and used it to create a basic iPhone game, which has been downloaded from the Cydia store over 4500 times. I also took Udacity's CS101 online class, which covered uses of Python, which I passed with the second highest grade, as well as small courses in JavaScript from Codecademy. I feel that knowledge of a high-level language, coupled with the Assembly language taught in my AS Electronics course, has shown me the great breadth of computing and how versatile computing as a whole can be, from the smallest microcontroller to the largest supercomputer, and this enthrals me.
            <p>
            I have complimented my Electronics AS level with A-Levels in Further Maths and Physics, which help give me the logical thinking and information that helps in Computer Science. On choosing my A-Levels, I was disappointed that my school did not offer Computing as an AS option. However, I felt my education was lacking in pure computing, so I consulted my head of year, and I entered myself as a private candidate in AS Computing, and I taught myself the course.
            </p>
            I have built upon the Assembly language that was taught to me, in a project to make a digital clock using a PIC microcontroller and an Assembly program. This task has not only been enjoyable, but has been a good experience of creating a product from design to production. I started with an idea, coded the program and refined it, built a prototype to test it and finally created a soldered end product. In creating this, I have learned more about the physical components of such a system, as well as practical skills, such as soldering and debugging code, which I had no experience of when I started.
            </p>
            I undertook 2 weeks of work experience at Large Public Organisation's IS&T Department, which involved working with the different areas that are required for maintaining the network of such a large organisation. This showed me the scale of the technology that is required and the tasks this entails. At school, I am known among students and teachers for my computing knowledge, and my head of sixth form has asked me personally to produce a magazine-style document for local distribution within a local newspaper.
            </p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with and making electronics, playing video games and reading. I like watching ice hockey, and I play recreationally with friends. Last year, I took a night class at the University of Somewhere in beginners' Japanese, which I took because it was interesting and I feel it expands on the breadth of my knowledge. I was also part of my school's team for the 2011 UK Maths Challenge, where we reached the regional finals. I follow Formula 1 almost religiously, and I have been accepted as a volunteer marshal at Silverstone Circuit.
            </p>
            It has always been my dream to study Computer Science at degree level, and I have worked towards it for as long as possible, and I am an enthusiastic, willing and able student. I am eagerly awaiting studying Computer Science at university, to explore new areas of computing and go deeper into existing areas.
