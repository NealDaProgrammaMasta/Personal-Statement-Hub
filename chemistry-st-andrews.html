            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            I can remember myself pondering the workings of a strange chart on my Primary School wall; it was the Periodic Table. As far back as then, I was intrigued by the mysteries of chemistry. I was an ardent reader of the 'Horrible Science' series of books and demanded that my class carried out some of the seemingly mad experiments. My interest in the subject grew as I progressed through secondary school. Instead of wanting to watch experiments, I would find myself asking why reactions happened. My enquiring mind simply was not satisfied with the bare description that the textbook provided.
            </p>
            While studying Higher chemistry, I particularly enjoyed the 'World of Carbon' unit, which dealt with chemical structure and bonding. I was fascinated by the precision and perfection of a molecule's shape and how this was achieved. To satisfy my curiosity, I began reading parts of the Advanced Higher syllabus, learning that it was due to electron pair repulsion. Sadly, xxxx xxxx School is unable to teach Advanced Higher chemistry but they did give me access to a distance learning program, allowing me to informally teach myself. It has strengthened my desire to study the subject, giving me a taste of what I will be learning at university.
            <p>
            Many chemists are employed in industries that require teamwork and management skills. Last year I led xxxx xxxx School's Young Enterprise team as Managing Director. We enjoyed a string of successes throughout the year, culminating in our company gaining third place in the UK (out of over two and a half thousand). As a result of the experience, my leadership and organisational skills have significantly improved. I have also become a confident public speaker, giving presentations in London to over three hundred accomplished business people and fellow Young Achievers. In addition to third place, we won a separate award from international manufacturer, GKN Plc for excellence in production quality and innovation. Using creativity to develop innovative solutions to difficult problems is useful in every occupation, not least that of a chemist. My interpersonal skills and confidence have been furthered by working as a waiter in my parent's small hotel for the past two years. Interacting with a wide variety of people on a regular basis and learning to adapt to new situations quickly I hope will bode well for the future.
            </p>
            Outside of school, I am a keen reader. "The Economist" magazine feeds my interest in economics, technology and current affairs. My hobbies include clay pigeon shooting, off-road driving and cross-country running. For my final year of school, I am not taking any formal qualifications, however I occupy my time by continuing to help the current Young Enterprise team and by representing the school in local events. Most recently, I visited Dingwall Academy during a teacher training seminar where myself and a friend set up a stall selling our company's garden furniture. We were highly successful, taking over one thousand pounds in orders which will be credited to the school fund. In addition to this, I have also taught the Higher chemistry class for the past half-term in conjunction with a physics supply teacher. This was a very rewarding experience and one of the highlights of my school career.
            </p>
            I have elected to undertake a degree in chemistry because I find it to be the most intellectually stimulating of all three sciences and the most applicable to my future career goals. Upon graduation, I intend to seek employment within the energy industry with the goal of being able to pioneer the next generation of renewable fuels and make a difference to our world.
