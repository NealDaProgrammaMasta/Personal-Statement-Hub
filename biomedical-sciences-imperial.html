            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            What draws me towards Biomedical Science is my desire to learn in depth about processes that occur at a molecular level to the functioning of organ systems. Particularly, the direct interactions between our bodies with diseases and the multitude of different responses we can give to these encounters.

            An article by NEJM detailing the use of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that treats malaria, made me eager to understand the mechanisms of mAbs and their involvement in cancer treatment. This led me to write my Extended Research Project, "To what extent are mAbs an effective combinational treatment against adenocarcinomas?", and I enjoyed the satisfaction of grasping complex ideas through conducting research. I gained an insight into the process of clinical trials from selecting patients to close examinations years after treatment, through reading a case study on the use of Pertuzumab against pancreatic cancer. The project helped to enhance my organisational and analytical skills by adhering to deadlines and interpreting new graphs or theories.

            My curiosity on the conflict between ethics and science within clinical trials led me to read 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' by Rebecca Skloot. HeLa cells became revolutionary in the world of cell culture, enabling scientists to unlock a myriad of medical breakthroughs such as a vaccine for polio. Although her cells were taken without consent which was a drawback to the achieved success; I was intrigued by the versatility of these cells due to their immortal nature, caused by overactive telomerase preventing cell apoptosis, enabling them to divide endlessly. The HeLa cell line creation highlighted perseverance and diligence to me, deepening my appreciation for clinical research. Its ability to recently help in producing COVID-19 vaccines displayed that one success can indefinitely lead to another.
            </p>
            My work experience in the Wood Lab focused on extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a type of intercellular communication for drug delivery of biological drugs. I performed a luciferase assay on cells treated with EVs and lysed cells by sonification. Through this, I learnt the importance of protocols and taking responsibility for errors you may make and it improved my precision in demonstrating practicals at school. Shadowing the use of a nanoFCM machine to measure concentrations of EVs, reinforced my attention to detail when using advanced technology, whilst also being able to work in an interdependent manner. Attending an Oxford Summer course further supplemented my exploration in cell biology. I learnt about the use of CDK and p53 protein in controlling the cell cycle, and how a mutation of p53 may lead to a dysregulated cell cycle. This aided me in writing an essay on the importance of mutation, where I delved into the classification of them and how they could help find root causes to identify cures. I delivered a presentation on CRISPR as I was intrigued about this customisable gene editing tool, and its future applications in developing therapies. I questioned whether this ground-breaking discovery had any flaws and found its major limitation, off-targeting editing. This course widened my knowledge beyond the A level specification and I flourished by collaborating with like-minded people, fuelling each other's aspirations.

            Being a Sports Leader at school has enhanced my problem-solving skills, as I led and adjusted activities based on students' abilities. Playing the drums and flute at a high standard whilst being able to balance this with my studies, has grown my resilience. I have also developed leadership skills through organising my school's annual lecture by reaching out to speakers and planning the event. I believe that I will thrive in University life with the skills I have acquired and my aim is to contribute greatly towards future healthcare.
