            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            My interest in the sciences began from an early age. As a child I spent hours catching frogs, toads and insects in the garden so I could observe them and understand how they lived. My fascination grew as we began to learn about the human body at school, and the way different organs interacted. As I learned more, this developed into a strong interest in the basic processes of life, such as molecular biology and genetics: how something so small like the base sequence on a polynucleotide can affect so much.
            </p>
            Reading books like "The Language of the Genes" by Steve Jones has made me realise that this is still a very recent and developing area of science, with huge potential to change the way we treat genetic diseases and tackle other biological problems. Through this and other reading, such as New Scientist, I have also come to understand the importance of new research leading to medical advances, for example development of the new malaria vaccine currently in trial. I feel that biological sciences are at the heart of some of the most exciting and fast-moving advances in science currently, and I would very much like to contribute to that by pursuing a career in this area.
            <p>
            Studying chemistry, physics and mathematics at AS Level has also helped me recognise the critical role that these subjects play in extending our understanding of biological processes. For example, learning about intermolecular bonds in chemistry, such as hydrogen bonds, helped me understand biological molecules. I fully understood water and its qualities and then how these help organisms survive. My different science courses have also helped me know how to plan, complete and evaluate experiments successfully in different scientific contexts. Studying mathematics has also made me confident in applying statistical processes to analyse how much we can rely on the results.
            </p>
            Another area of interest is biotechnology, which brings together my interests in biology and physics. This has come particularly from my participation in the Engineering Education Scheme, providing an opportunity to work on an applied science project in an industrial environment. Our project included designing and making a fully working de-icing product, writing up a project and making presentations to a group of senior professional engineers. As well as showing how the different sciences work together, it helped me develop my team working, time management and presentation skills, as well as making me realise how motivated I can become when I get deeply involved in a project. I was delighted to receive a BA Gold Crest Award on completing the project.
            </p>
            Aside from my school work I have gained my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award, and have also been volunteering at my local Oxfam shop weekly for the last two years, which has helped me gain skills in terms of interacting and working with people. I have now become a trusted volunteer, enabling me to improve processes, for example in coding different kinds of stock for gift aid, helping me develop leadership skills as well as increasing my confidence.
            </p>
            Although I am particularly interested in molecular, genetic, and cellular biology, I am keen to do a broadly based degree in biological sciences, so that I can gain an overall understanding across the different disciplines before specialising. I know I am enthusiastic and passionate enough to succeed in studying biology to a higher level. I hope university will be a stimulating and exciting experience where I can deepen my understanding of biology as well as gaining a broad range of professional and personal skills for my future career.
