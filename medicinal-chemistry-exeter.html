            Exploding custard powder! My first memorable experiment was at a Dr. Bunhead Science show when I was 10 and, although I didn’t understand what happened, I knew I wanted to know more about what I had just caused. I became a keen reader of the ‘Horrible Science’ series which sparked my curiosity.
            </p>
            I will always remember my first Chemistry practical lesson. It was a simple experiment, but my teacher’s enthusiasm and interest in the subject really inspired me to become fascinated with Science even more. With his continual support, I found myself asking more questions about how and why different phenomena occur. In that same year I was one of three pupils selected to attend Salters’ Chemistry Camp at Cambridge. I learnt how to make an iodine clock, paint, glow in the dark slime and aspirin, as well as how to use an IR machine, something not available in school. It was a truly amazing experience. Throughout my A level courses, I have been particularly interested in Organic Chemistry and its application in Biology. The chance to visit King’s College London and University Campus Suffolk was a brilliant opportunity. I was able to speak with second year students studying Biochemistry and see the use of X-ray crystallography and its application to drug design. This really cemented my interest in drug synthesis.
            <p>
            Due to an advert in a magazine, I was given the opportunity to work voluntarily in a hospital in Tanzania. After seeing the poor conditions, I was further inspired to work in drug design, as many deaths could be prevented by cheaper and more readily available medication. Also while I was there I had to be flexible when I was placed in different departments. This demonstrates my ability to handle change and adapt to new situations.
            </p>
            At school I decided to do an Extended Project Qualification, looking at the effect of plant oils as antibiotics and if they could be a suitable replacement. I learnt new Science skills such as how to melt and pour agar plates, streaking bacteria and aseptic techniques. Following a scientific process, I had to create a hypothesis, observe the results and change my method accordingly. In addition, I gave a presentation about my findings to teachers which developed my public speaking. I also entered my findings into the Google Science fair.
            </p>
            Effective communication is a vital skill for any scientist, which I have developed through my part time job with Chelmsford City Council. I coach children in many different sports and organise pop parties, where I am required to choreograph and teach dance routines. With this job I need to be able to converse with work colleagues, parents and children.
            </p>
            I have held many different leadership positions at school. I was selected to become a prefect and I had to work with other members as a team to help manage the school and care for younger pupils. In addition to this, I have had the privilege to assist in Year 7 and 8 Science lessons. I have had to learn to phrase scientific concepts in a way so that all abilities can understand, passing my enthusiasm for the subject onto them. It is a very rewarding experience.    
            </p>
            One of my hobbies is Kung Fu and I am currently on my ninth out of twelve grades. I also enjoy Irish Dancing and I have competed on a national level, placing third.
            </p>
            I want to further my studies in the chemistry of living organisms at a degree level as I find it exciting and awe-inspiring, as well as constantly evolving as new discoveries are ever changing. I believe that my passion, diligence and dedication will lead to success in a degree and beyond, with hope to introduce better or new medications to improve people’s health around the world.
