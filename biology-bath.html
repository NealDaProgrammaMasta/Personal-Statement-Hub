            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>

            Living organisms are the most convoluted structures known to humans and studying the importance of these organisms and the growing pressure on all species from emerging diseases, climate change and population growth are central to these organisms survival. Biology is one of the most mysterious disciplines left on earth and after attending my first Biology AS lesson I left the classroom with numerous questions about the microscopic world and knew that I wanted to learn more about the cell and the innate but fundamental and central role that it has in all living organisms. Biology is the subject that interests me most because every day new and exciting biological discoveries are made in laboratories and new technological advances within biology such as the recent Philae landing which only furthers my desire to join this innovative and challenging field.
            </p>
            Reading the New Scientist magazine and Biological Science Review has further developed my interest in biology. An in depth article on how a tiny pacemaker, placed in a rabbit that regulated its heart beat using beams of energy from outside of its body was engrossing and sustained my curiosity for biology.
            <p>
            Work experience in the research unit of the haematology department at the University Hospital of Wales provided me with an insight into the biological advances made in the treatment of leukemia. Working alongside researchers I amplified DNA samples using PCR and also observed haematologists separating blood samples and removing white blood cells for further research. This gave me a valued insight into the empathy required and challenges faced in this field. My interest in biology flourished after attending a lecture by Professor Hugh, comparing DNA and proteins at a local university. This also gave me insight into the life of a biology student.
            </p>
            Being actively involved in a range of extra-curricular activities has also developed my interest in biology. Working with younger pupils in ‘what’s lurking in the water’ made me aware of the fascinating subject of environmental biology. This involved investigating the diversity of key groups of organisms found in rivers, measuring the flow rate, depth and also the PH of the water. Studying the key niches in the river and participating in this enterprise assisted the development of my analytical skills, the ability to collect far reaching data and gain theoretical and practical skills. Being a part of sixth form has provided a range of opportunities to be involved in voluntary and fundraising events for charity. Volunteering as a mentor in the schools numeracy and literacy scheme, involves reading with year 7 pupils, helping with their English by discussing key concepts as a group and working as a team. This further developed communication skills as I had to communicate information in a clear and structured manner. I am really grateful for the experience that this provided.
            </p>
            Since being in sixth form I have also used my skills to help local charities by organizing a bag packing event in a local supermarket raising over £300 for a local charity. These academic and personal experiences have allowed me to develop a range of transferable skills, which will be of great benefit in higher education.
            </p>
            Working part time in retail has developed my communication skills when assisting customers. It also requires using initiative while also working as part of a team and the importance of time management with balancing part time work alongside school work. Outside the school environment sport has always been one of my greatest interests, being an active member of the Bridgend athletics club for 5 years has encouraged self-motivation, patience and perseverance which are essential in sport but also in academia.
            </p>
            Biology is a field that is rapidly developing and is a career that cannot be entered halfheartedly. I am dedicated and passionate about the subject and prepared for the challenge of exploring the many biological mysteries present today.
