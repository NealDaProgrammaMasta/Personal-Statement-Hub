            <h2>Full Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>
            Having committed much of my time to reading scientific articles, such as the Biological Review I have gained a growing interest in the field of biology, particularly RNA and its role in disease development and mutations .This has been supplemented by reading "Cats are not Peas" which has provided an insight into the strange world of genetics and how variation within species helps provide a greater understanding of the human genome. "The Human Mind" has encouraged me to explore the 'Body over mind' debate. Staying at the cutting edge of developments in the biological field is of great importance to me as it is a broad subject and a fast evolving area of research. With biology holding many areas to specialise in; it is precisely this scope which encourages me to read it at university. With the concept of molecular characteristics holding influence over the physiology of organisms remaining at the forefront of my mind, I took Biology at A-level. My interest in learning about organisms stemmed from a molecular level and extends to the ecological elements of the course which I am looking forward to learning in greater depth. Studying AS Chemistry will provide me with a foundation to develop an understanding of molecules and their properties. By acquiring necessary skills to test hypotheses and question theories I have been able to gain a greater depth of knowledge and stronger evaluative skills within the scientific disciplines. By diversifying my A-level subject choice away from science I have been able to improve the fluidity of my extended writing and question the applications of theories in daily life whilst taking account of potential conflicts that could arise, providing a wider approach to the ethics of the stem cell debate. Throughout college I have gained skills essential to future success. Beyond the formal biology curriculum I attend extension lectures at college which explore topics not covered by the syllabus for example addiction, which nurtured my interest in neuroscience. Furthermore, I am currently participating in "anatomy and physiology" classes from which I gained a further understanding of the human body and how to approach dissection. This influenced my decision to gain experience in pathology and microbiology labs within hospitals which allowed me to appreciate the application of processes used in a clinical environment. I was also impressed at the technique and skill required to do for procedures such as gram staining in the identification of bacteria and its implications for treatment. To reinforce my knowledge I have taken on the role of a biology tutor to younger years which has aided me to take a different approach to assignments and further enhanced my communication skills which would be essential to group tasks by being able to communicate with a wider audience. During my school career I have actively been involved in a range of activities and taken on roles of responsibility including being a senior prefect and organising a charity concert where I gained the ability to express ideas and take on leadership roles with confidence. Furthermore, I participated in athletics meets which led me to compete for the region. This strengthened my time management skills and perfect athletic techniques expected at a level. By doing the community sports leader award I was able to work with a variety of people and volunteer at special needs schools over a year where I learned the importance of teamwork, trust and communication within teams and implemented processes which could be used in situations throughout university. These skills have been reinforced in the role of Captain of my lacrosse team. My education has allowed me to develop a passion for the world at a molecular level; this has been fuelled further by doing A-levels and immersing myself in biological research. With my thirst for knowledge I aspire to understand the world at such a level and one day perhaps contribute to the bank knowledge we possess.
