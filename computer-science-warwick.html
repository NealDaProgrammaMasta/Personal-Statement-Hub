            <p>
            P=NP or P vs. NP is a long standing problem within Computer science. It asks if a problem can be solved easily, can its solutions be checked efficiently? Having tried to solve this myself and ended up with disappointment, I would really like try to attempt to find out the answer.
            </p>
            Algorithms come in different complexities from Google finding your search results within a fraction of a second and Facebook friend suggestions to as simple as sorting a few numbers; algorithms are all around us and are at the core of all computer systems. Problems and algorithms like these have inspired and motivated me to study and expand my current knowledge in the fast moving and vast field of Computing. With the death of Steve Jobs, the brilliant visionary, we lost a great computer scientist and entrepreneur who changed the way we use technology. Not only has he inspired me to be bold and innovative about my approaches to computing and programming, he has also taught me to be courageous in the work I do.
            <p>
            Using computers from an early age, I always wondered how they managed to draw pictures, play songs and run games so quickly and with such ease, speed and precision. Growing up in the "Computer Generation", not only did I want to use programs, I also wanted to create my own.
            </p>
            My love and passion for Computing increased steadily as I grew older and my own understanding capabilities improved. I have been part of a nine man team working on the Cassini Huygens for our year 12 Extended Project. The Cassini Huygens is a mission to Saturn with the intention of accurately plotting its Magnetosphere in three dimensions. Our job was to analyse data provided by NASA of the magnetic field strengths to spot these "crossings". Due to the massive amount of data records we had to analyse, Excel soon proved to be useless. Therefore, I was given the task of developing a program for us to use. This has not only enabled me to learn new programming and algorithmic concepts but also gave me the opportunity to learn about the Cassini Huygens space probe and magnetosphere of Saturn from researchers at the Mullard Space Science Lab. Challenges like this power my passion and motivate me to learn more computer science and be innovative in my approaches to work. This also encouraged me to do some more work experience in the field.
            </p>
            Furthermore, I have taken part in maths and physics Olympiads to test my knowledge gaining silver and bronze certificates. Along with my love for Computing, I am extremely passionate about music and playing the keyboard. After choosing Music as one of my GCSE options, I discovered how entertaining and pleasurable it was to be able to play a musical instrument. Not only did it give me another means of expressing my emotions but also allowed me to be creative.
            </p>
            I have enjoyed work experience at KBR in the IT department where I was taught to use HTML to archive web pages within the Intranet and Oracle packages and procedures. I have also worked again during the summer of 2011 where I had to work with Excel and write macros in VBA to produce graphs to represent simulated trends on the HYSIS software package. Although it was a different experience for me, I soon became accustomed to the environment and completed the work to a "high standard."
            </p>
            I am also a key member of the school as a Geography mentor in year 12 and a Study Prefect in year 11 mentoring lower school students in a range of subjects. This has not only enabled me to be a better communicator with others but also helped me boost my own confidence as well as gaining some teaching skills. In addition, in year 12, this previous experience as a Study Prefect meant I was able to carry out two complete forty five minutes lessons for a Year 3 class at Hackbridge Primary School.    
            </p>
            I am looking forward to the challenges that university provides and believe that a Computer Science course will provide an excellent opportunity to further develop my skills and prepare me for future life and employment.
